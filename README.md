# GCLR
GCLR: Generalizable Continual Learning with Regularization Elastic Weight Consolidation on Medical Image Continual Learning Classification

# Abstract
Will be posted after paper published.

# Proposed Architecture
The process framework for continual learning adopted in this study demonstrates the step-by-step methodology applied to sequential datasets.
